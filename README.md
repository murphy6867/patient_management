# Patient Management System | In Progress

I'm developing a Java-based Patient Management System aimed at streamlining patient data handling and administrative tasks within healthcare settings. This project is a hands-on exploration of building scalable, modular applications using modern Java practices.


## Technologies & Tools:

- Java with Spring Boot for backend development

- gRPC for efficient inter-service communication

- Docker for containerization and environment consistency

- Modular architecture to separate concerns (e.g., patient-service, billing-service)

---
**Current Progress:**

- Established foundational microservices for patient and billing operations

- Implemented initial API endpoints for patient data management

- Set up Docker configurations for seamless deployment

---
**Next Steps:**

- Integrate a frontend interface for user interaction

- Enhance data validation and error handling mechanisms

- Implement authentication and authorization features

This project is a work in progress, reflecting my commitment to continuous learning and application of full-stack development principles.
